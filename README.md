# Advanced Autodesk VRED Python Samples
A collection of advanced python scripting samples and tutorials for Autodesk VRED 2020

### Goal:
The goal of this free-to-use code samples is to give some insights to lesser known VRED python API features and expand the knowledge about VRED python scripting (and python scripting in general).

Autodesk VRED offers a plethora of python scripting samples and snippets that are really great and helpful. But some scripting techniques and API features are either not documented or covered in the API samples. This repository offers some examples that show these advanced features.
